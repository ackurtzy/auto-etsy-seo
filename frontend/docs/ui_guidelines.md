Contrast

Keep body text contrast ≥ 4.5:1 against its background.

When using the primary accent on light backgrounds, rely on weight/typography as well as color for emphasis (not color alone).

Typography

Use a serif for emphasis and a sans-serif for most UI text.

Font Stacks

Serif (headings / emphasis)

"Georgia", "Times New Roman", serif

Weight: 700 for strong emphasis.

Sans-serif (body / UI)

"Inter", "Segoe UI", "Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif

Weights: 400–600 for normal to medium emphasis.

Suggested Hierarchy
(Developers may adjust sizes as long as the relative hierarchy is clear.)

Page titles:

Georgia, bold, ~26–30px, slight negative letter-spacing (e.g. -0.2px).

Section/panel titles:

Georgia, bold, ~18–22px, text color #1f2a37.

Body text:

Sans-serif, 15–16px.

Small labels/help text:

Sans-serif, 12–13px, use secondary text color #4c5d73.

Emphasis Rules

Use Georgia bold selectively for:

Important headings.

Key metrics or short status labels.

Prefer weight and hierarchy over excessive color changes; color accents should reinforce, not replace, typographic structure.
